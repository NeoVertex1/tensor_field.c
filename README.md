# tensor_field.c

## **Tensor Field Prototype in C**
This project is a **prototype implementation** of a tensor field system in C. It is designed as a starting point to explore tensor-based operations, eigenvalue computations, and data visualization. While the current implementation provides basic functionality, it sets the stage for more advanced features.

---

### **Key Features (Current State)**
1. **Tensor Field Representation**:
   - A `4x4` tensor structure (`TensorField`) is defined and initialized with static or file-based data.

2. **Basic Eigenvalue Computation**:
   - Eigenvalues of the tensor are computed using the **GNU Scientific Library (GSL)**.
   - Results are printed to the terminal for analysis.

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Tensor data can be loaded from a file for modularity and experimentation.

4. **Visualization (Prototype)**:
   - Tensor data is saved in a format compatible with `gnuplot` for visualization.
   - Visualization is rudimentary and focuses on displaying tensor values.

---

### **What This Project *Doesn't* Do (Yet)**
1. **Advanced Tensor Operations**:
   - No support for tensor contractions, SVD, or Fourier transforms.
   - Multiplication or other transformations are not implemented.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Limited robustness; the prototype assumes correct input formats.
   - Edge cases (e.g., invalid files, ill-formed tensors) are not fully handled.

3. **Integration with Real-World Systems**:
   - The project currently lacks applications beyond simple demonstrations.

4. **AI/ML Features**:
   - Tensor eigenvalues are not yet integrated into machine learning pipelines.

### **How to Use**

#### **1. Building the Prototype**
Ensure the **GSL library** is installed on your system. Use the provided `Makefile` to compile the project:

```bash
make
```

#### **2. Running the Program**
Run the executable to initialize the tensor, compute eigenvalues, and save data for visualization:

```bash
./tensor_field_project
```

#### **3. Outputs**
- **Eigenvalues**: Printed to the terminal for inspection.
- **Visualization Data**: Saved in `plots/tensor_plot.gp` for plotting.

---

### **Example Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Define Tensor Data**
The tensor is loaded from `data/real_data.txt`:
```plaintext
44.8 0.28082 0 3.14159
0.28082 3721.8 64713.97 0
0 64713.97 3.14159 0.28082
3.14159 0 0.28082 44.8
```

#### **Step 2: Compute Eigenvalues**
Eigenvalues are computed using GSL:
```plaintext
Eigenvalues:
47.9416
41.6584
66603.1
-62878.2
```

#### **Step 3: Visualize Data**
The tensor data is saved in `plots/tensor_plot.gp` for visualization. Use `gnuplot` to render it:
```bash
gnuplot
```
```gnuplot
set pm3d
set palette defined (0 "blue", 1 "green", 2 "yellow", 3 "red")
splot "plots/tensor_plot.gp" matrix with lines
```

### **Installation Requirements**
- **GNU Scientific Library (GSL)**:
  Install with Homebrew on macOS:
  ```bash
  brew install gsl
  ```

- **Gnuplot** (Optional, for visualization):
  ```bash
  brew install gnuplot
  ```
